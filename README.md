# Flight-Booking
Minimal Flight booking web-app in django , mainly for learning purposes

OK..so why i am learning django...thing is that i have these ideas running around my head all the time for some cool web-apps that i can use in my daily life or maybe be others too, if its fits thier purpose...now, i could have gone for MEAN or MERN stack...but, the thing is its all bullshit..you basically learn one language/framework go deep (as per your project needs), build fun projects around it..let them face the real world, learn the feedback..and re-iterate...only after doing this.. I THINK one can easily (atleast for me!!!) adapt to other framework when situation demands and..i definately want try my hands on other stakcks as well...but WE WILL WORK BACKWARDS FROM THE PROJECT , NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND!
